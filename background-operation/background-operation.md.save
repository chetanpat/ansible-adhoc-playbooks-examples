# Ansible-AdHoc-Commands

## Run operations in the background mode  

### Some operations take a lot of time to finish (minutes or even hours). For example, when you run *yum update* or *apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade*, it could be a few minutes before all the packages on your servers are updated. In these situations, you can tell Ansible to run the commands asynchronously, and poll the servers to see when the commands finish.
To run a command in the background, you set the following options: 
1. -B <seconds>: the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to let the job run. 
1. -P <seconds>: the amount of time (in seconds) to wait between polling the servers for an updated job status.
```
$ ansible all -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "yum update -y"
```
